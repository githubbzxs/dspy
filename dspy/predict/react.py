        ReAct stands for "Reasoning and Acting," a popular paradigm for building tool-using agents.
        In this approach, the language model is iteratively provided with a list of tools and has
        to reason about the current situation. The model decides whether to call a tool to gather more
        information or to finish the task based on its reasoning process. The DSPy version of ReAct is
        generalized to work over any signature, thanks to signature polymorphism.

        Args:
            signature: The signature of the module, which defines the input and output of the react module.
            tools (list[Callable]): A list of functions, callable objects, or `dspy.Tool` instances.
            max_iters (Optional[int]): The maximum number of iterations to run. Defaults to 10.
            parallel_tool_calls (Optional[bool]): Whether to enable parallel tool execution. Defaults to False.
                When True, allows the LLM to request multiple tool calls in a single turn that execute concurrently.
                When False, maintains sequential execution (one tool per turn).

        Example:

        ```python
        def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
            return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

        react = dspy.ReAct(signature="question->answer", tools=[get_weather])
        pred = react(question="What is the weather in Tokyo?")

Thoughts and Planned Improvements for dspy.ReAct.

TOPIC 01: How Trajectories are Formatted, or rather when they are formatted.

Right now, both sub-modules are invoked with a `trajectory` argument, which is a string formatted in `forward`. Though
the formatter uses a general adapter.format_fields, the tracing of DSPy only sees the string, not the formatting logic.

What this means is that, in demonstrations, even if the user adjusts the adapter for a fixed program, the demos' format
will not update accordingly, but the inference-time trajectories will.

One way to fix this is to support `format=fn` in the dspy.InputField() for "trajectory" in the signatures. But this
means that care must be taken that the adapter is accessed at `forward` runtime, not signature definition time.

Another potential fix is to more natively support a "variadic" input field, where the input is a list of dictionaries,
or a big dictionary, and have each adapter format it accordingly.

Trajectories also affect meta-programming modules that view the trace later. It's inefficient O(n^2) to view the
trace of every module repeating the prefix.


TOPIC 03: Simplifying ReAct's __init__ by moving modular logic to the Tool class.
    * Handling exceptions and error messages.
    * More cleanly defining the "finish" tool, perhaps as a runtime-defined function?


TOPIC 04: Default behavior when the trajectory gets too long.


TOPIC 05: Adding more structure around how the instruction is formatted.
    * Concretely, it's now a string, so an optimizer can and does rewrite it freely.
    * An alternative would be to add more structure, such that a certain template is fixed but values are variable?


TOPIC 06: Idiomatically allowing tools that maintain state across iterations, but not across different `forward` calls.
    * So the tool would be newly initialized at the start of each `forward` call, but maintain state across iterations.
    * This is pretty useful for allowing the agent to keep notes or count certain things, etc.
